        Naada Gama is not a strange name for urban music lovers and the local
        music scene. Rather, it has created its brand name within a very short
        time span. A bunch of equally talented young vocalists - Ridma
        Weerawardana, Dinupa Kodagoda, Methun SK, Supun Perera and Dinesh
        Gamage, known for their contribution to the music industry, decided to
        put together their talents and create something mesmerising for the Sri
        Lankan concert scene. Although they share a similar passion and causes
        of inspiration for music, the ‘famous five’ sing their own genres they
        are good at. The five different vibrant styles on stage could capture
        audiences and that could be a reason behind their success within a very
        few months.
